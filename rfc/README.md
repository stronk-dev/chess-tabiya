**Exploration gate opened by owner ruling 2026-08-12** (logged in
`planning/exploration/log.md`): E1 met, E2 advisory, E3/E4/E5 accepted as in-flight
risk with their experiments folded into implementation. Previously: The repo is in the exploratory phase.
The first experimental vertical-slice RFC may be drafted only after the
exploration-to-slice gate in `planning/exploration/gates.md` passes, or an owner ruling
(logged in `planning/exploration/log.md`) opens it early. Product RFCs remain closed until
the slice passes the later continuation gates. See the "Exploration gate" section of
`0000-rfc-process.md`.

**Breadth sequencing ruling, 2026-08-11:** the owner opened design and RFC
planning for the complete B1–B8 product surface in
`design/03-product-breadth.md`. This does not waive RFC review or authorize
unspecified implementation; it supersedes the assumption that the next work is
content for one narrow slice. Breadth RFCs must preserve the global shell and
name the B-gates they complete before code begins.

## Archive

| RFC | Status | Canonical docs link |
|---|---|---|
| `archive/branch-runtime.md` | implemented | `docs/branch-runtime.md` |

## The archive sketches are quarry, not RFCs

`archive/brief-v2/rfcs/RFC-0001..0008` and `archive/brief-v2/adrs/ADR-0001..0006` are
pre-validation decision sketches from the brief. They are design-tier material: future
real RFCs mine them for content and cite them, but nothing in `archive/` has RFC status.
Their topics are tracked as rows in `design/BACKLOG.md`; the ADR decisions are tracked
in that file's Provisional decisions table with revisit triggers.

## Deferred decisions register

Decisions deliberately punted, each with a named owner so defaults are not chosen
silently later.

| Deferred decision | Origin | Owner | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|---|
| Server language | ✅ resolved 2026-08-12: **TS core + Go workers** doctrine (chess-semantics code is TS/shared runtime; self-contained data-format workers are Go; Python only inside Maia sidecar containers) | — | `design/research/stack-selection.md` |
| Client framework | ✅ resolved 2026-08-12: **Svelte 5** + Vite | — | `design/research/stack-selection.md` |
| SQLite vs PostgreSQL for runs/branches | ✅ resolved 2026-08-12: **SQLite ratified**. PostgreSQL remains a bounded follow-up for multi-host deployment or demonstrated write contention. Ruling and proposal: `planning/archive/branch-runtime/log.md` | — | `docs/branch-runtime.md` |
| Source model, deployment, monetization, and content/data rights | exploration Q2 | Marco | Gates public release; GPL/AGPL obligations constrain combinations but do not prohibit charging |
