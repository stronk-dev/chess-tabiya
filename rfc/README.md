## Active

| RFC | Status | Parent | Implementation |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0000-rfc-process.md` | accepted | — | process |
| `terminal-outcome-events.md` | implementing | amends branch runtime | `planning/terminal-outcome-events/`; closes D11; **blocks** B6b and B6d |
| `learner-identity-and-authorization.md` | implementing | foundation F3 | `planning/learner-identity-and-authorization/` |
| `pack-optional-runs.md` | implementing | foundation F2; F3 landed first | `planning/pack-optional-runs/` |
| `content-sourcing-foundation.md` | implementing | program item #6 (B6a) | `planning/content-sourcing-foundation/` |
| `content-sourcing-syzygy.md` | implementing | program item #6 (B6b) | `planning/content-sourcing-syzygy/` |
| `content-sourcing-explorer.md` | implementing | program item #6 (B6c) | `planning/content-sourcing-explorer/` |
| `content-sourcing-position-seeds.md` | implementing | program item #6 (B6d) | `planning/content-sourcing-position-seeds/` |

**Content-sourcing split, 2026-08-12.** An adversarial review rejected the single
`content-sourcing-pipelines.md` draft and recommended a four-way split; the draft
is deleted, not stubbed, and its content is fully rehomed. **B6a is the
foundation and the other three name it in `Depends on:`** — it ships the artifact
triple (`pack.json` / `evidence.json` / `sources.json`), the fetch manifest, the
deterministic-output rule, the licence and attribution encoding required by the
2026-08-12 content-rights ruling, the `sourcing-check` gate, and the
`chess-openings` line skeleton. Landing order is **B6a → B6b → B6c → B6d**
(reasoning in `content-sourcing-foundation.md` §6). B6d is a **redesign**, not a
rehome: the withdrawn §5 asked the learner to solve the tactic, which
`design/00-thesis.md:70,93-94` rejects.


**Exploration gate opened by owner ruling 2026-08-12** (logged in
`planning/exploration/log.md`): E1 met, E2 advisory, E3/E4/E5 accepted as in-flight
risk with their experiments folded into implementation. Previously: The repo is in the exploratory phase.
The first experimental vertical-slice RFC may be drafted only after the
exploration-to-slice gate in `planning/exploration/gates.md` passes, or an owner ruling
(logged in `planning/exploration/log.md`) opens it early. Product RFCs remain closed until
the slice passes the later continuation gates. See the "Exploration gate" section of
`0000-rfc-process.md`.

**Breadth sequencing ruling, 2026-08-11:** the owner opened design and RFC
planning for the complete B1–B8 product surface in
`design/03-product-breadth.md`. This does not waive RFC review or authorize
unspecified implementation; it supersedes the assumption that the next work is
content for one narrow slice. Breadth RFCs must preserve the global shell and
name the B-gates they complete before code begins.

## Migration register

Instituted 2026-08-12 after two RFCs drafted in parallel both claimed database
migration 2 and `STORAGE_VERSION` 1→2, so neither could land independently. A
migration number is a **shared, single-writer resource**; claim it here before
writing it into a draft.

| Migration | `STORAGE_VERSION` | Owner RFC | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0→1 | shipped | implemented; **body** rewritten by `pack-optional-runs.md` §8 to stop replaying through `projectRun` (no version change, no new number) |
| 2 | 1→2 | `learner-identity-and-authorization.md` | implementing |
| 3 | 2→3 | `pack-optional-runs.md` | implementing; migration 2 landed first |
| 4 | 3→4 | `terminal-outcome-events.md` | implementing; upgrades ordinary v0.5 snapshots and quarantines pre-producer outcome events |
| 4 | 3→4 | `terminal-outcome-events.md` | draft — run schema v0.6; upgrades eligible v0.5 snapshots and the indexed column, quarantines rows carrying a pre-producer `outcome.reached` |

A migration's *number* is the shared resource, but its *body* is shared too: an
already-applied migration still runs on databases that never reached it, so a
schema change can break a migration it did not touch. Record body edits here as
well.

**Landing order is F3 before F2**, decided 2026-08-12 on three grounds: D1 is a
live defect (a run link is a write credential) and the deployment ruling is
hosted multi-user, so identity is a prerequisite to exposing anything at all;
F2's v0.4 snapshot quarantine is simpler to write once ownership columns exist
than the reverse; and F2 is the riskier change (`RunService.create` becomes
async across ~15 call sites), so it should not also carry the migration that
another draft depends on. F2 must rebase its migration to 3 and state the
dependency explicitly.

Any RFC touching persisted shape adds its row here in the same commit that
drafts the migration.

## Withdrawn

Kept for the record (RFC-0000: `withdrawn` = abandoned, not superseded). Their
findings are salvaged into content-era BACKLOG rows — read the withdrawal notes
before re-attempting this territory.

| RFC | Why |
|---|---|
| `withdrawn/authoring-contracts-v03.md` | Specified an authored vocabulary with no authored content to design against; three reviews, three variations of that fault |
| `withdrawn/evidence-composer.md` | Prerequisite withdrawn; the packet abstraction proved unnecessary for v1 |

## Archive

| RFC | Status | Canonical docs link |
|---|---|---|
| `archive/branch-runtime.md` | implemented | `docs/branch-runtime.md` |

## The archive sketches are quarry, not RFCs

`archive/brief-v2/rfcs/RFC-0001..0008` and `archive/brief-v2/adrs/ADR-0001..0006` are
pre-validation decision sketches from the brief. They are design-tier material: future
real RFCs mine them for content and cite them, but nothing in `archive/` has RFC status.
Their topics are tracked as rows in `design/BACKLOG.md`; the ADR decisions are tracked
in that file's Provisional decisions table with revisit triggers.

## Deferred decisions register

Decisions deliberately punted, each with a named owner so defaults are not chosen
silently later.

| Deferred decision | Origin | Owner | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|---|
| Server language | ✅ resolved 2026-08-12: **TS core + Go workers** doctrine (chess-semantics code is TS/shared runtime; self-contained data-format workers are Go; Python only inside Maia sidecar containers) | — | `design/research/stack-selection.md` |
| Client framework | ✅ resolved 2026-08-12: **Svelte 5** + Vite | — | `design/research/stack-selection.md` |
| Client routing | ✅ resolved 2026-08-11: **hand-rolled history-API router** (~100 lines); no SvelteKit migration, no routing dependency | — | `rfc/archive/app-shell.md` AS-C5 |
| SQLite vs PostgreSQL for runs/branches | ✅ resolved 2026-08-12: **SQLite ratified**. PostgreSQL remains a bounded follow-up for multi-host deployment or demonstrated write contention. Ruling and proposal: `planning/archive/branch-runtime/log.md` | — | `docs/branch-runtime.md` |
| Source model, deployment, monetization, and content/data rights | exploration Q2 | Marco | Gates public release; GPL/AGPL obligations constrain combinations but do not prohibit charging |
